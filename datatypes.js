datatypes
 2 types of datatypes - 1.primitive data type (Numbers-1,2,3,1,1, String- "Rajan", boolean- true and false)
                        2.Non primitive data types(object, array, etc)
//mostly data are stored into variable.for ex: Numbers, String, boolean, undefined
//Type coercion (auto-conversion)
//conditions
//loops
//object {data of different primitive data typess}

Array is collection of data,different data are allowed here

0      1        2       3      
Murali,Rohan,Rohit,Gaurav are element of the array
Array is assigned as index(like 0,1,2,3)
Index will start from 0,negative index give undefined as output
Array is special type or refined type of an object
if array is created and some metod is already defined,then it is called as predefined method
Array and object store collection of data,array is special case and in array we have more feature of accessing data 
but object holds the classical way.array is just implementation of object
